## This project currently NOT accepting feature PRs!
This project is very specific to my needs/desires and under active development while I figure out what those needs/desires are. =) Feel free to send bugfixing PRs, but all requested features will be ignored until I have finished deciding what features I want to have.

Basically this project is public just in case someone might find this useful for putting some open source contribution numbers in their CV.
